Unit Testing:

Mock the sounddevice library to test read_hertz and play_audio.
Test determine_dominant_pitch_in_hertz with a predefined NumPy array
(mock the audio data).

Test behavior first, then worry about inner workings:
- does class exist
- can it be instantiated
- are the methods callable
- do the methods return the expected results
